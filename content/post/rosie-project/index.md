I was shocking charmed by this book from the get-go. Media that centers around socially challenged folks (like Asperger syndrome in this case) can feel very trite and making humor of the situation very quickly feels like punching down. This book largely avoids a lot of those pitfalls and finds humor in the social awkwardness that feels directed towards encouraging Don or humor from his perspective. It also helps that all of his friends have very genuine relationships with him and work with him in positive and encouraging ways.

The book largely follows the traditional rom-com format, with a bumpy road for our couple and a mystery background plot. Rosie is introduced fairly early on and is a very charming character with her own quirks and preferences. Most of the other candidates for the Wife Project lead to comedic moments, especially the sole passing candidate Bianca. The dancing scene is among the best moments of the book, one that reminds us that Don has a bunch of empathy and prevents Don from becoming too saccharine. The other great scene, the bartending scene, is also excellent and gives us a moment to really celebrate Don's capabilities.

Maybe the only criticism I have of the book is that is comes close to treating Asperger syndrome like a superpower at times. I think the picking up dancing and bartending parts are where this is the most prevalent. It is hard to criticize it too much since the scenes payoff so well. The trip to New York for Don and Rosie is excellent and we get to learn a bit more about Rosie and Don in ways that make us appreciate them each more and really root for them. The ending of the trip maybe feels a bit too arbitrary and just sticking to the format of needing more drama leading into the final arc. It does allow the ending to shine and sets up some good eureka moments for Don culminating in their HEA. I am very interested in where Simsion takes the couple in the second part of the story and am looking forward to reading it.
