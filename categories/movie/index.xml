A lot of the same complaints apply here, every scene seems too long, most do not feel impactful, and there are plot lines shoehorned in just to pad the movie or check off some checkboxes for Hollywood blockbusters (KÃ­li and Tauriel I am looking at you). I do not think this move did anything better than Unexpected Journey, it just did a few things less bad, and had more Smaug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The action scenes here I feel are the more guilty of Hollywood blockbuster-fication. The river scene especially feels straight out of a pure action or comic book flick. There is nothing serious or impactful about them, they are too over the top to take seriously. They also just go on and on in a way that feels impossible to really track. It is fun watching Legolas snipe one or two baddies, but they really beat that dead horse in the name of fan service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only real highlight of the film is the Smaug. The animation of Smaug still holds up and is great. The banter between Smaug and Bilbo is also clever and tense. However, the action scene that follows falls into the same trap as the river barrel scene. What especially makes the scene worse, is as a viewer we are pretty certain all of the dwarves are going to make it out safely, so there is a real lack of tension in the sequence. It is just another scene, like so many in the movie, that halfway through you question why does this feel like it is just going on forever?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Klaus</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/klaus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/klaus/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Klaus_poster.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Klaus" />&lt;p>I have mixed feeling about holiday movies, and even with the ones I do like, they are often watched year after year until they no longer feel as special anymore. Which is why it is all the more exciting when a viable new one comes along. At first glance, nothing about Klaus looks like it is anything other than another entry in Netflix&amp;rsquo;s shotgun approach to making content; it is from a new production studio, it fells a specific niche, etc. But a broken clock can be right twice a day right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing that is striking about Klaus is the unique art style. It has this unique mix of sharp lines and exaggerated silhouettes with strong lighting and shading. The result is very textured and allows for a great deal of artistic direction and emphasis to important moments. I really hope we see more from SPA in this style. Once the movie gets going, it is a consistent onslaught of clever jokes and charm. Perhaps my favorite ongoing joke is the little girl who is seen stabbing carrots into things throughout the movie, but that is far from the only fun one. The other clever through line is the building of the Christmas lore (I personally found it even more charming that it was a very agnostic take on the whole thing). Some of it was predicable, but it did not feel trite or take away from the effect too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the only ding I really have against the movie is the forced drama in the final arc where everyone turns against Jesper since he was actually just acting in self interest all along. It is a very common format for kids movies and I only wish something more creative could have been used as a twist. I will forgive it since the movie ends so strongly with a shot on Jesper sleepily awaiting his yearly opportunity to see an old friend. If we are going to watch a holiday movie year after year, Klaus seems like a great one to give a shot for a while and I think the combination of a great animation style and loads of charm will make it an enjoyable one for a while.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hobbit: An Expected Journey</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/The_Hobbit-_An_Unexpected_Journey.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hobbit: An Expected Journey" />&lt;p>The novel The Hobbit is a delightful little story. It is relatively brief (well at least as brief for Tolkien standards) and does not seek to waste the reader&amp;rsquo;s time with fluff. The money-hungry decision to take that charming little story and pad it out with nonsense to three very long movies is a predictable, yet still sad decision which lead to each movie feeling drawn-out, vapid, and ironically incomplete (at the if the first of the trilogy is any indication).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems the way they planned on extending the story out to a trilogy was through making each scene as long as possible, far longer than the substance of the scene requires. As a result, I often found myself zoning out a bit thinking &amp;ldquo;why are we still here?&amp;rdquo;, as I thought though what is happening on the screen. Sure, the scenery is fantastic, but we did not need as many zoomed out walking scenes as we got. The battle scenes especially feel a bit long in the tooth and seem to celebrate special effects more than plot or character development. The battles are feel especially toothless knowing everyone is going to make it through to the end. Perhaps the only scene that really feels impactful is the meeting Gollum and the riddle battle, where the length of the scene felt proportional to the impact to the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have mixed feelings on the songs. On the one hand, it felt much more fun hearing them sung versus just words on a page. It helps that they are mostly accompanied but some fun hijinks. On the other hand, they are just as jarring in the movie as they are in the book. They often feel like an abrupt tonal shift that feels jarring. I find myself feeling shocked after a three hour movie that we are only a third of the way through this story, and I can only hope to be surprised if they figure out how to make the next two feel less empty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/Fantastic_Beasts-_The_Secrets_of_Dumbledore.png" alt="Featured image of post Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore" />&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s just make this single movie a trilogy&amp;rdquo; strikes again. While not quite as bad as the Crimes of Grindlewald, this movie falls flat for many similar reasons, mainly that it feels way too long for the amount of plot the movie conveys. Most scenes feel either too long or unnecessary and the cumulative effect by the end of the movie is tiring. There are a few charming and funny scenes (the dumb crab walk in the prison for example), but it all feels irrelevant to the main plot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The climax scene of the movie is also a great example of the sloppy storytelling found throughout the movie. All of a sudden we switch from what seems like an election, to just letting the Qilin choose the next leader and everyone is just going along with it? Not to mention earlier in the movie we are told that wizards did away with the Qilin selection because it was exceedingly difficult to find someone pure of heart enough, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are two people in the crowd that the Qilin finds pure hearted enough&amp;hellip; Then Grindlewald and Dumbledore fight a bit and them fighting breaks their blood pact trinket and there is not even a real attempt to explain it. It is all just MacGuffins and deus ex machina back and forth for three movies, so I guess it is fitting it finishes with one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was pretty clear from the start this one was going to be a mess of a plot when the messiness of the plot was explained away as a counter-measure to Grindlewald&amp;rsquo;s future sight. It justified any amount of unexplained surprises and confusing/unexplained decisions. Similar to the second movie, none of these lands and feels meaningful because there is no earned buy-in to any expectations about what is going on. Maybe there could have been some clever way to wrap it up that made for a satisfying romp, but this sure as hell was not it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Fantastic_Beasts_-_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald_Poster.png" alt="Featured image of post Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald" />&lt;p>I swill start off by saying it took us two nights to get through the movie. After what felt like an eternity the first go around, we realized we still had fifty minutes left and were not confident we were going to be able to stay awake to finish it off (and let&amp;rsquo;s just say the plot was not compelling enough an argument). Starting off with one positive, there are some really great visuals. The costume design is strong and blends allusions to historic styles with witchy elements that is effective. Also, the magic often looks great as well (at least when it looks magical and not just mechanical). However, this is all just visuals, everything below that is confusing and vapid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major problem with the movie is that the cental plot focusing on Credence&amp;rsquo;s origin story is not overly compelling and we are just told through monologues that it is of the upmost importance that he is not united with Grindelwald. In the meantime, the movie burns through characters in service of plot twists that are as confusing as they are unearned. In many cases, the plot twist follows just after we get some clarification about what the heck is actually going on. The result is that it all just feels meaningless, the twist only matters if we felt some clear expectation about what was going to happen, and the movie never gives us that grounding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also so little of a look into what is really compelling about Grindelwald vision. We have the allusion to World War II that feels slightly compelling in the moment, but does not explained what pulled so many wizards to the meeting in the first place. Credence&amp;rsquo;s pull was very personal and just about his origin. The only other character we get insight into is Queenie, and it is unclear if she was brainwashed or if she really believes in Grindelwald&amp;rsquo;s vision as the only path to happiness with Jacob. But Queenie&amp;rsquo;s story again does little to explain the rest of the mob, as her&amp;rsquo;s is about more free relations between wizards and muggles, and it sure seems like the rest of the mob wants a more clear pecking order and different place for muggles in society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am thankful there is only one more movie in the series to call it done&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
