Getting the negative out of the way first, most episodes do not need the full hour time slot. Many episodes would feel more effective in a half hour time slot, and the show feels stretched to fill out the full hour. There is no better example of this padding than the intro sequence. It feels so long and all we get is a rotating image of Deep Space Nine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the stationary setting of Deep Space Nine, the show mostly focuses on particular types of stories with the social and political dynamics of the Bajoran and Federation relationship and trade through the wormhole. There are a few away mission style missions mixed in as well, but we spend most of our time on Deep Space Nine. This mostly just shifts the format from the Enterprise going somewhere, to stuff coming to Deep Space Nine. The cast of characters is mostly good, Odo and Dax are standouts and both unique and very interesting characters with evolving backgrounds. Kira, Sisko, and Quark are all fairly standard characters that work well with the types of stories the show wants to tell (and of course it is nice to see O&amp;rsquo;Brien again). My least favorite character is Dr. Bashir, who is often annoying and not nearly as interesting as past doctors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some standout episodes in the first season. &amp;ldquo;Dax&amp;rdquo; has a classic trial style episode that examines justice and existence in the context of a multi-lifespan species. &amp;ldquo;Progress&amp;rdquo; examines those left behind by industrialization. &amp;ldquo;If Wishes Were Horses&amp;rdquo; is a strange but delightful one where characters thoughts manifest and create a whole bunch of conflicts around the station. There are a bunch of episodes reflecting on religion, mostly focused on Bajoran and Federation dynamics that are mostly strong, including &amp;ldquo;In the Hands of the Prophets&amp;rdquo; as the standout. On the other hand, we do get an annoying Q episode with &amp;ldquo;Q-Less&amp;rdquo;, which is kinda as annoying as other Q episodes from past series. And it would not be Star Trek without some episodes that toe the lines into nonsense like &amp;ldquo;Move Along Home&amp;rdquo; with the board game made real. All in all I am looking forward to more Star Trek Deep Space Nine and working through the rest of the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/rosie-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/rosie-project/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371651741i/16181775.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion" />&lt;p>I was shocking charmed by this book from the get-go. Media that centers around socially challenged folks (like Asperger syndrome in this case) can feel very trite and making humor of the situation very quickly feels like punching down. This book largely avoids a lot of those pitfalls and finds humor in the social awkwardness that feels directed towards encouraging Don or humor from his perspective. It also helps that all of his friends have very genuine relationships with him and work with him in positive and encouraging ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book largely follows the traditional rom-com format, with a bumpy road for our couple and a mystery background plot. Rosie is introduced fairly early on and is a very charming character with her own quirks and preferences. Most of the other candidates for the Wife Project lead to comedic moments, especially the sole passing candidate Bianca. The dancing scene is among the best moments of the book, one that reminds us that Don has a bunch of empathy and prevents Don from becoming too saccharine. The other great scene, the bartending scene, is also excellent and gives us a moment to really celebrate Don&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe the only criticism I have of the book is that is comes close to treating Asperger syndrome like a superpower at times. I think the picking up dancing and bartending parts are where this is the most prevalent. It is hard to criticize it too much since the scenes payoff so well. The trip to New York for Don and Rosie is excellent and we get to learn a bit more about Rosie and Don in ways that make us appreciate them each more and really root for them. The ending of the trip maybe feels a bit too arbitrary and just sticking to the format of needing more drama leading into the final arc. It does allow the ending to shine and sets up some good eureka moments for Don culminating in their HEA. I am very interested in where Simsion takes the couple in the second part of the story and am looking forward to reading it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reincarnated as a Sword Volume 15</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/reincarnated-as-a-sword-15/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/reincarnated-as-a-sword-15/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1725708585i/218466271.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Reincarnated as a Sword Volume 15" />&lt;p>One of the longest entries in the series so far, volume fifteen does not do all that much different than the rest of the series, but still is fun enough to keep going. It shares a lot of the same slight annoyances from the other entries, stuff like: confusing magic system that keeps adding new terms for power creep, lots of severe injuries immediately healed by magic, and a inconsistent durability system. It is tough to keep track of some of it, but thankfully it feels like it does not really matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new entry to the magic system this time around is a time traveling trick that affects a few of the side characters causing future versions of themselves from a different timeline to meet their current incarnations. The most interesting part is when Teacher and Fran are introduced to their other versions, ones where Teacher fully becomes a sword leading to Fran becoming increasingly berserk. While mostly nonsense, the becoming a sword thing is sort of an interesting twist and the scene where they meet is solid. Winelene was also a fun character and I am interested in seeing where Wine and Lene go from here (if we get to see more of that).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/The_Hobbit_-_The_Desolation_of_Smaug_theatrical_poster.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" />&lt;p>I think Desolation of Smaug at least cleared the bar of being ever so slightly better than An Unexpected Journey, but only by a hair. A lot of the same complaints apply here, every scene seems too long, most do not feel impactful, and there are plot lines shoehorned in just to pad the movie or check off some checkboxes for Hollywood blockbusters (KÃ­li and Tauriel I am looking at you). I do not think this move did anything better than Unexpected Journey, it just did a few things less bad, and had more Smaug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The action scenes here I feel are the more guilty of Hollywood blockbuster-fication. The river scene especially feels straight out of a pure action or comic book flick. There is nothing serious or impactful about them, they are too over the top to take seriously. They also just go on and on in a way that feels impossible to really track. It is fun watching Legolas snipe one or two baddies, but they really beat that dead horse in the name of fan service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only real highlight of the film is the Smaug. The animation of Smaug still holds up and is great. The banter between Smaug and Bilbo is also clever and tense. However, the action scene that follows falls into the same trap as the river barrel scene. What especially makes the scene worse, is as a viewer we are pretty certain all of the dwarves are going to make it out safely, so there is a real lack of tension in the sequence. It is just another scene, like so many in the movie, that halfway through you question why does this feel like it is just going on forever?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Klaus</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/klaus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/klaus/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Klaus_poster.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Klaus" />&lt;p>I have mixed feeling about holiday movies, and even with the ones I do like, they are often watched year after year until they no longer feel as special anymore. Which is why it is all the more exciting when a viable new one comes along. At first glance, nothing about Klaus looks like it is anything other than another entry in Netflix&amp;rsquo;s shotgun approach to making content; it is from a new production studio, it fells a specific niche, etc. But a broken clock can be right twice a day right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing that is striking about Klaus is the unique art style. It has this unique mix of sharp lines and exaggerated silhouettes with strong lighting and shading. The result is very textured and allows for a great deal of artistic direction and emphasis to important moments. I really hope we see more from SPA in this style. Once the movie gets going, it is a consistent onslaught of clever jokes and charm. Perhaps my favorite ongoing joke is the little girl who is seen stabbing carrots into things throughout the movie, but that is far from the only fun one. The other clever through line is the building of the Christmas lore (I personally found it even more charming that it was a very agnostic take on the whole thing). Some of it was predicable, but it did not feel trite or take away from the effect too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the only ding I really have against the movie is the forced drama in the final arc where everyone turns against Jesper since he was actually just acting in self interest all along. It is a very common format for kids movies and I only wish something more creative could have been used as a twist. I will forgive it since the movie ends so strongly with a shot on Jesper sleepily awaiting his yearly opportunity to see an old friend. If we are going to watch a holiday movie year after year, Klaus seems like a great one to give a shot for a while and I think the combination of a great animation style and loads of charm will make it an enjoyable one for a while.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>True Detective S3</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/true-detective-s3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/true-detective-s3/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/True_Detective_season_3.png" alt="Featured image of post True Detective S3" />&lt;p>I took a long break from True Detective after the mess of a second season the show produces for its sophomore effort. I even figured that was quite possibly the final season we would see. I heard that season three was made, but went with a wait and see approach and honestly just forgot about it. I heard some hype for season four and felt it was proper to catch up before watching it (even if the seasons are not related). It is nice to be pleasantly surprised sometimes right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am foremost glad that the overly complicated web of unexplained connections as left behind in season two. Right off the bat, starting with detectives recalling a previous case mirrors the first season and feels compelling right away. The case does get complicated, with lots of interleaving narratives from the three different time periods, but it happens at a reasonable pace that does not feel overwhelming. Hays&amp;rsquo; Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s also complicates these narratives, but in way that is engaging and adds empathy. The opportunity to feel empathy feels welcome, as generally speaking, the characters are all morally complicated and while we are rooting for them, they are not classic pure good guys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The eight episodes feel like just the right amount of time to spend on the case. Maybe the weakest part of the story is the final reveal of the whodunit, but I feel that it can be forgiven with the discovery that Julie is alive and well and how that scene plays out. There are a lot of great themes at play here around the cost of serving and the complicated places it leaves veterans in, outsiders in rural america, and the death of rural areas. I guess we can all just forget season two ever happened and be happy that there was a strong return to form here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hobbit: An Expected Journey</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/The_Hobbit-_An_Unexpected_Journey.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hobbit: An Expected Journey" />&lt;p>The novel The Hobbit is a delightful little story. It is relatively brief (well at least as brief for Tolkien standards) and does not seek to waste the reader&amp;rsquo;s time with fluff. The money-hungry decision to take that charming little story and pad it out with nonsense to three very long movies is a predictable, yet still sad decision which lead to each movie feeling drawn-out, vapid, and ironically incomplete (at the if the first of the trilogy is any indication).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems the way they planned on extending the story out to a trilogy was through making each scene as long as possible, far longer than the substance of the scene requires. As a result, I often found myself zoning out a bit thinking &amp;ldquo;why are we still here?&amp;rdquo;, as I thought though what is happening on the screen. Sure, the scenery is fantastic, but we did not need as many zoomed out walking scenes as we got. The battle scenes especially feel a bit long in the tooth and seem to celebrate special effects more than plot or character development. The battles are feel especially toothless knowing everyone is going to make it through to the end. Perhaps the only scene that really feels impactful is the meeting Gollum and the riddle battle, where the length of the scene felt proportional to the impact to the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have mixed feelings on the songs. On the one hand, it felt much more fun hearing them sung versus just words on a page. It helps that they are mostly accompanied but some fun hijinks. On the other hand, they are just as jarring in the movie as they are in the book. They often feel like an abrupt tonal shift that feels jarring. I find myself feeling shocked after a three hour movie that we are only a third of the way through this story, and I can only hope to be surprised if they figure out how to make the next two feel less empty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trust by Hernan Diaz</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/trust-hernan-diaz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/trust-hernan-diaz/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631246461i/58210933.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Trust by Hernan Diaz" />&lt;p>For about the first half of this book it is not really clear where we are going, which did make it a little less &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo; off the line. The Rask story as a standalone is not particularly special and its connect with the autobiographical draft is not immediately clear. Thankfully, the stage-setting does not wear out its welcome and when Ida&amp;rsquo;s perspective introduces the connection it feels like an earned twist. It quickly becomes a complex detective game with a satisfying reveal at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of what makes the novel so successful is how reasonable it would be to believe any single account of the historical story of Andrew and Mildred Bevel. Each story successfully justifies its perspective on these characters. It is also interesting how all the stories are about capital and the wielding of capital. The Rask story is about a tycoon who wields wealth to make more wealth, even at substantial cost to the stability of the market. The autobiography is about Andrew applying wealth to impose his will on the world, erase public perceptions of his life that are not to his liking and fill in the gap with his own narrative. Ida&amp;rsquo;s memoir is about a being exposed to the world of wealth from the outside and juxtapositioning it against an anarchist anti-capitalist upbringing. Finally Mildred&amp;rsquo;s diary communicates her struggle with being the mastermind behind the plan, but due to her gender, being unable to be the face of the plan due to societal gender roles and norms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The point being made here about wealth having an strong force over narrative and perception is not novel on its own, but what makes it work here is the tightness of the story telling and the tiny bits and pieces we are encouraged to reflect back on after being presented with new evidence and perspectives. The theme of trust at the center of the novel is as important as ever to reflect on. It shows how public perspective and narrative can be bought and the danger of trusting those stories without critical analysis. It is also not the last of an infinite series of self-important capitalist mongrels messing up the world for the rest of us while pitching themselves as the hero.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/ghost-in-the-shell-arise-alternative/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/ghost-in-the-shell-arise-alternative/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/72037.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture" />&lt;p>Getting back to Ghost in the Shell after taking a break is an immediate reminder to how interesting the psychological and philosophical questions that lie at the core of the world building. While the original movie still stands the test of time, I have enjoyed the increased time to bake the tv series are privy to. Arise is an interesting case as well, as it is a new origin story, and most characters are pretty darn similar, except for Mokoto&amp;rsquo;s appearance (which I thought would be explained, and maybe I missed it&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My main criticism of Arise is that of the five movies in the tv serialized version of it (Alternative Architecture), there is just a bit of unevenness. None are particularly bad, but some of them feel rushed and one or two feel stretched. Seeing Mokoto and Batou start on opposite sides was different and gave some more depth to their relationship. The same is true for a few of the other characters, but Batou definitely got the most screentime of the rest of the crew. More Logicoma is always a good thing as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fire-Starter virus was always interesting in the original movie, but it felt like the movie had to juggle Mokoto&amp;rsquo;s inner struggle and the impact of the virus, and the result was a bit less time to see just how impactful the virus could be. The five episodes in Arise gives us different stories about how the virus is being used and the difficulty of combatting it. I think at the end of the day it is probably not as strong as some other series in the canon (like SAC), but I am a sucker for Production I.G and deeper and more pensive dives into philosophical questions, and Arise is both of those things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/Fantastic_Beasts-_The_Secrets_of_Dumbledore.png" alt="Featured image of post Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore" />&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s just make this single movie a trilogy&amp;rdquo; strikes again. While not quite as bad as the Crimes of Grindlewald, this movie falls flat for many similar reasons, mainly that it feels way too long for the amount of plot the movie conveys. Most scenes feel either too long or unnecessary and the cumulative effect by the end of the movie is tiring. There are a few charming and funny scenes (the dumb crab walk in the prison for example), but it all feels irrelevant to the main plot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The climax scene of the movie is also a great example of the sloppy storytelling found throughout the movie. All of a sudden we switch from what seems like an election, to just letting the Qilin choose the next leader and everyone is just going along with it? Not to mention earlier in the movie we are told that wizards did away with the Qilin selection because it was exceedingly difficult to find someone pure of heart enough, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are two people in the crowd that the Qilin finds pure hearted enough&amp;hellip; Then Grindlewald and Dumbledore fight a bit and them fighting breaks their blood pact trinket and there is not even a real attempt to explain it. It is all just MacGuffins and deus ex machina back and forth for three movies, so I guess it is fitting it finishes with one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was pretty clear from the start this one was going to be a mess of a plot when the messiness of the plot was explained away as a counter-measure to Grindlewald&amp;rsquo;s future sight. It justified any amount of unexplained surprises and confusing/unexplained decisions. Similar to the second movie, none of these lands and feels meaningful because there is no earned buy-in to any expectations about what is going on. Maybe there could have been some clever way to wrap it up that made for a satisfying romp, but this sure as hell was not it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>With a Little Luck by Marissa Meyer</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/with-a-little-luck-marissa-meyer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/with-a-little-luck-marissa-meyer/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1686948017i/63291997.jpg" alt="Featured image of post With a Little Luck by Marissa Meyer" />&lt;p>I have mostly enjoyed everything by Marissa Meyer after getting pulled into The Lunar Chronicles series. I do not think anything has been quite as good as that series, but still very enjoyable. Something about her particular style of magical realism/fairytale magic is very charming and makes for fun reads. The only book that did not quite grab me was Instant Karma, which was probably amongst the least &amp;ldquo;magical&amp;rdquo; of her novels. Still a fun read, but not one I think about often. When I heard we were heading back to Fortuna Beach for a round two, I was happy to see a bit more of these characters, but also a bit hesitant since this world was not my among my favorites from Meyer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am always happy to be proven wrong. While I would admit that this book at times feels downright pandering to a nerd audience, it is effective in how it breaks down the traditional nerd and popular kids social circles. It definitely makes me wish that traditional nerdy hobbies had crossed over more into the mainstream when I was in my high school years. There is without a doubt as portion of my enjoyment of this story that is derived from this wish-fulfillment, but the particular way it reflects on social circles and perceptions is where it prevents it from feeling trite. One memorable example is where nerd Jude and popular girl crush Maya are discussing social life and Maya explains that social circles can feel like boxes, that she felt limited by the expectations of others on those in the popular girl clique. It refined a somewhat unbelievable quirk of Maya being very interesting and adept at D&amp;amp;D into something that allows for a more empathetic and relatable perspective on Maya. Moments like these (and there are a few) were a refinement of story arcs that did not quite hit the mark in Instant Karma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is not to say this is a perfect story. The pure luck related to the magic d20 went a bit too far and felt contrite. The thirty-plus heads coin flips was too much for example, and on the flip side the bad luck felt too punishing. There were a subset of perceived good luck occurrences (like Jude developing a friendship with Maya) and perceived bad luck occurrences that felt like they were derived from confidence (or lack of), but the over the top ones blurred the lines a bit too much. It felt the most successful when it hit that magical realism sweet-spot. It was also great to see some more of Prudence and Quint and how they are living out their HEA in their own quirky way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not perfect and a bit too campy at times, I was really delighted by With a Little Luck, and found myself flying through the back half with a lot of glee.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Fantastic_Beasts_-_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald_Poster.png" alt="Featured image of post Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald" />&lt;p>I swill start off by saying it took us two nights to get through the movie. After what felt like an eternity the first go around, we realized we still had fifty minutes left and were not confident we were going to be able to stay awake to finish it off (and let&amp;rsquo;s just say the plot was not compelling enough an argument). Starting off with one positive, there are some really great visuals. The costume design is strong and blends allusions to historic styles with witchy elements that is effective. Also, the magic often looks great as well (at least when it looks magical and not just mechanical). However, this is all just visuals, everything below that is confusing and vapid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major problem with the movie is that the cental plot focusing on Credence&amp;rsquo;s origin story is not overly compelling and we are just told through monologues that it is of the upmost importance that he is not united with Grindelwald. In the meantime, the movie burns through characters in service of plot twists that are as confusing as they are unearned. In many cases, the plot twist follows just after we get some clarification about what the heck is actually going on. The result is that it all just feels meaningless, the twist only matters if we felt some clear expectation about what was going to happen, and the movie never gives us that grounding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also so little of a look into what is really compelling about Grindelwald vision. We have the allusion to World War II that feels slightly compelling in the moment, but does not explained what pulled so many wizards to the meeting in the first place. Credence&amp;rsquo;s pull was very personal and just about his origin. The only other character we get insight into is Queenie, and it is unclear if she was brainwashed or if she really believes in Grindelwald&amp;rsquo;s vision as the only path to happiness with Jacob. But Queenie&amp;rsquo;s story again does little to explain the rest of the mob, as her&amp;rsquo;s is about more free relations between wizards and muggles, and it sure seems like the rest of the mob wants a more clear pecking order and different place for muggles in society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am thankful there is only one more movie in the series to call it done&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Shinji Ikari Raising Project Omnibus, Volume 1</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/shinji-ikari-raising-project-omnibus-volume-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/shinji-ikari-raising-project-omnibus-volume-1/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453062591i/28109977.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Shinji Ikari Raising Project Omnibus, Volume 1" />&lt;p>I am continuing to work my way through the extended Evanglion world, and did not quite know what to expect with this one. Inspired from a beloved scene in the original series where there were no angels, our main trio (Shinji, Asuka, and Rei) are running to school and faced with what seems like a much more normal life. I know there are quite a few volumes in this series, so it was not immediately clear what the plot driver would be here. Even in fan-service-laden harems, there is usually something to keep everyone moving forward. Right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Omnibus contained the first three manga, which is good, since after just the first manga, it was not really clear what was the hook here (again, besides pure fan-service). The second manga delivered some better moments (and of course, contrived visits to the beach), and while still falling short of a good hook, showed signs of life. The manga is at its best when there are allusions to events from the main series, but take a much different turn. Some of these are very successful, for example, the power outage that is resolved by a group bike generator marathon. Others do not quite hit the mark (the initial something goes wrong with Rei&amp;rsquo;s sync feel empty without any real explanation as to why we are in plugs). These have been fun enough overall to stay engaged, but I hope there is some better hook down the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One final positive note, I think a lot of the characters are fun in their re-imagined format. Misato is fun as homeroom teacher and her bumbling nature is equally fitted for this world with lower stakes. Full on socially awkward Gendo is excellent, and he becomes the highlight of many of the scenes he is in. An earlier introduction of Kaworu mirrors the re-imagined movie series and main series manga and it continues to be great to give him more time in the story (and mission yaoi is entertaining). Rei and Asuka fair a little worse though. Without the Eva piloting, and Rei acting a bit more assertive very early on, the comparison between the two reduces to one of physical comparisons and bust size, which is not particularly interesting nor deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that I like to finish what I start, I am on the train for the whole ride, so I only hope it goes from just a midly entertaining ride to something a bit more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
