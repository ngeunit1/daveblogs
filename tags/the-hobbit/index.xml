A lot of the same complaints apply here, every scene seems too long, most do not feel impactful, and there are plot lines shoehorned in just to pad the movie or check off some checkboxes for Hollywood blockbusters (KÃ­li and Tauriel I am looking at you). I do not think this move did anything better than Unexpected Journey, it just did a few things less bad, and had more Smaug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The action scenes here I feel are the more guilty of Hollywood blockbuster-fication. The river scene especially feels straight out of a pure action or comic book flick. There is nothing serious or impactful about them, they are too over the top to take seriously. They also just go on and on in a way that feels impossible to really track. It is fun watching Legolas snipe one or two baddies, but they really beat that dead horse in the name of fan service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only real highlight of the film is the Smaug. The animation of Smaug still holds up and is great. The banter between Smaug and Bilbo is also clever and tense. However, the action scene that follows falls into the same trap as the river barrel scene. What especially makes the scene worse, is as a viewer we are pretty certain all of the dwarves are going to make it out safely, so there is a real lack of tension in the sequence. It is just another scene, like so many in the movie, that halfway through you question why does this feel like it is just going on forever?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hobbit: An Expected Journey</title><link>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveblogs.me/p/hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/The_Hobbit-_An_Unexpected_Journey.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post The Hobbit: An Expected Journey" />&lt;p>The novel The Hobbit is a delightful little story. It is relatively brief (well at least as brief for Tolkien standards) and does not seek to waste the reader&amp;rsquo;s time with fluff. The money-hungry decision to take that charming little story and pad it out with nonsense to three very long movies is a predictable, yet still sad decision which lead to each movie feeling drawn-out, vapid, and ironically incomplete (at the if the first of the trilogy is any indication).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems the way they planned on extending the story out to a trilogy was through making each scene as long as possible, far longer than the substance of the scene requires. As a result, I often found myself zoning out a bit thinking &amp;ldquo;why are we still here?&amp;rdquo;, as I thought though what is happening on the screen. Sure, the scenery is fantastic, but we did not need as many zoomed out walking scenes as we got. The battle scenes especially feel a bit long in the tooth and seem to celebrate special effects more than plot or character development. The battles are feel especially toothless knowing everyone is going to make it through to the end. Perhaps the only scene that really feels impactful is the meeting Gollum and the riddle battle, where the length of the scene felt proportional to the impact to the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have mixed feelings on the songs. On the one hand, it felt much more fun hearing them sung versus just words on a page. It helps that they are mostly accompanied but some fun hijinks. On the other hand, they are just as jarring in the movie as they are in the book. They often feel like an abrupt tonal shift that feels jarring. I find myself feeling shocked after a three hour movie that we are only a third of the way through this story, and I can only hope to be surprised if they figure out how to make the next two feel less empty.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
